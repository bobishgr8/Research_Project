# Research_Project

This is all the code that i used for a NJ E-StAR research project

## Task 1

For this task, I needed to model an image in a math opperable and computer understandable object. Therefore the bluk of the code here is to change the imgaes into matrixes. 

## Task 2

In this task, the main goal is to find if 2 matrixes are the same. So no biggie.
Was mainly just:
> if matrix1 == matrix2: 

## Task 3

In this task, it is to see if a computer is able to understand that the 2 images are the same but are slightly eidited. For example, both shows the Effiel Tower, but one is a image of it in day time while the other on is in night time.
